## STA-141b Final Project:
    Damien Amzallag and Skye Nadel
    
In our project we analyze Food and Drug safety in the United States from the Food and Drug Administration API. The FDA databases gave us an opportunity to explore very consequential information pertaining to the safety and health of the United States. We analyzed multiple databases within the API, including adverse drug events and food recall data. We answer questions such as what are the most common indications that lead to adverse drug reactions for each age group since 2010? What were the most problematic brands of drugs that led to serious complications since 2010? What are the most common drug classes of adverse drug event reports for each age group ? What are the most commonly reported pharmaceutical companies that produced the drugs that led to adverse reactions? Which drug classes are the most dangerous regardless of age group? Which states have the most drug recalls and if there are any that have way more why is that, and which industries have the most adverse effects? 

The file named overall_project_notebook.ipynb contains our entire project in order and has all analysis in it as well.  The FDA's Foods database and its Drugs database are primarily used, as well as the populations.xlsx and the drugPic.png.
