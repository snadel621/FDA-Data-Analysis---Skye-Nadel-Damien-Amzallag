## STA-141b Final Project:
    Damien Amzallag and Skye Nadel
    
In our project we analyze Food and Drug safety in the United States.  We answer questions such as which drugs are being used and affect which age groups the most, which states have the most drug recalls and if there are any that have way more why is that, and which industries have the most adverse effects.

The file named overall_project_notebook.ipynb contains our entire project in order and has all analysis in it as well.  The FDA's Foods database and its Drugs database are primarily used, as well as the populations.xlsx and the drugPic.png.  

Open overall_project_notebook.ipynb for all code and analysis.
